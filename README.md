This project aims to create a website that allows the type of skin cancer to be determined using deep learning. Technologies such as Flask, JWT, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras were used in our project for functions such as creating the website, user authentication, and image processing
# Skin Cancer Detection Website
This project is a Flask web application integrated with a machine learning model for skin cancer type detection. This website includes user authentication and detection part from uploaded images or images accessible via url.

### Libraries:
**_Machine learning:_** Tensorflow-Keras for model creation and prediction. Also libraries such as numpy, pandas, opencv, matplotlib, PIL, requests and splitfolders has been used.

**_Flask:_** Web framework for building the API.

**_Authentication:_** Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT-based authentication.

### Model Setup:
**_EfficientNetB3:_** This pre-trained model used as the base.

**_ImageDataGenerator():_** Used for data augmentation and normalization.

**_EarlyStopping and ReducedLR0nPlateau:_** Included for optimization.

The data is preprocessed then the model is trained, evaluated and saved.

### Flask Application: 
**_Initialization:_** Configures the Flask app, initializes database, loads the trained model, and sets up JWT for authentication.

**_Blueprint:_** Defines routes within a blueprint for modular organization.

**_Register/Login:_** Handles user registration and login.

**_Detection:_** Handles image uploads and URL-based image processing for skin cancer detection, returning predictions with confidence percentage and detailed information.
